  "summary": "I have a rich and diverse career path in software development, spanning over six years and three countries. I started as an intern at a startup, where I learned Ruby on Rails and ReactJS. I then joined a digital payments company, where I improved my skills in NodeJS, API development, and databases, and became a Technical Lead for a challenging project. I also provided remote software development consultancy services to Portugal, where I mastered ReactJS, NodeJS, and discovered Golang. In 2022, I earned an MBA in Software Architecture from IGTI, enhancing my vision for building robust solutions. I also mentored at Mais1Code, helping new talents enter the programming world.\nMy ultimate goal is to become an expert in developing reliable, secure, and high-quality applications, and to help as many people as possible find their place and grow in the software development field.\nLet’s connect and explore new possibilities together!",
